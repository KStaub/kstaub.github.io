<p>I try harder than I give myself credit for, and keep getting better over time. I enjoy puzzles, games, concepts, and conversations. I like software
	engineering, it is a fun and interesting way to solve problems. Our society and communities need more people working
	together to do good. If you're reading this, and you want to chat, you can find me on the world wide web.</p>
